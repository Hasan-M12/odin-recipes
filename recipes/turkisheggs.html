    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These Turkish eggs were a delicious surprise for me! I feel like I've seen
      and done it all at my age, so you can only imagine my delight at finding a
      new way to prepare eggs. I would never have thought to pair yogurt with
      poached eggs and spicy red pepper butter, but it might be my new favorite
      breakfast. Serve with toasted crusty bread for dipping.
